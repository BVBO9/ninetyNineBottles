Ninety Nine Bottles of Beer
Develop a program that will print the lyrics to the song "Ninety Nine Bottles of Beer." 
If you have an objection to the lyrics, or just want to exercise your creativity, 
you may substitute some other thing to count down in a similar manner.

Features

This assignment features new material that we have covered. Specifically:

Functions (Optionally)
Loops
Decisions

Requirements

D Effort:
Deliver a non-working program that was headed in the right direction.

C Effort:
The lyrics must cover from 99 to 0 bottles of beer. That means it must end with a 
whole verse about there being 0 bottles of beer on the wall. For instance:

	Zero bottles of beer on the wall.
	Zero bottles of beer.
	We've taken them down and passed them around.
	Now we're drunk and passed out!

B Effort
Ask the user how many bottles of beer there are and count down from there. 
Handle invalid conditions, such as being asked to count down from -99 bottles.

A Effort:
The lyrics must be in words. That is you must not print the number "99", but the words "Ninety Nine."

Hints

The most brute-force way of converting numbers from 0 to 99 into words is an if-elif-else structure with 100 possibilities. 
Consider using functions to handle the "tens" digit and handle the "ones" digit. Just be aware the "teens" (11-19) will be exceptions. 
If you're asking an AI to write code for you, it will likely use language features we have not yet covered, such as lists, to make this code more compact. 
That would be a sign that perhaps you're letting the AI be the brain and that you're the tool.
